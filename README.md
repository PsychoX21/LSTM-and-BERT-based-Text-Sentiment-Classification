# Transformer-and-LSTM-based-Sentiment-Analysis

This repository contains multiple approaches to perform sentiment analysis on movie reviews, including:

-   An Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) -based custom implementation using PyTorch and NLP preprocessing on custom labeled dataset
-   Fine-tuning a BERT model for supervised binary classification on IMDB movie reviews dataset
-   An interactive Gradio app for user-friendly sentiment predictions for the BERT model

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository and change directory to inside its folder.
2. Install all requirements as shown in the section above.

### LSTM Sentiment Analysis (PyTorch)

1. Open `Sentiment_Analysis_using_LSTM.ipynb` in Jupyter/Colab.
2. Run all cells sequentially
3. Ensure the `reviews.csv` dataset is present in the same directory as the jupyter notebook.
4. `state_dict.pt` will be saved after running the cells

### BERT Fine-Tuning Notebook

1. Go inside the directory `Movie Review BERT/`
2. Open `fine_tuning.ipynb` in Jupyter.
3. Run all cells sequentially.
4. The above operation saves the trained BERT weights to `trainedmodel/` in the same directory
5. To run the Gradio app, run the `gradio_app.py`
